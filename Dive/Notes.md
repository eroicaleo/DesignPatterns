* Data stored inside the object’s fields is often referenced
  as state, and all the object’s methods define its behavior.

# Pillars of OOP

Four pillars:

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance

## Abstraction

Your objects only model attributes and behaviors of
real objects in a specific context, ignoring the rest.

Abstraction is a model of a real-world object or phenomenon, limited to a specific context, which represents all details relevant to this context with high accuracy and omits all the rest.
