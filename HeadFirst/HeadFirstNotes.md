# Chapter 01 Welcome to design patterns: Strategy Pattern

The duck problem, inheritance is not a solution because some ducks don't fly,
some ducks even don't quack.

Interface example:

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

public class MallardDuck extends Duck implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("MallardDuck is flying!");
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Looks like a Mallard Duck");
    }
}

```

Interface is also not the solution because if we want to change the `fly()`
behavior, we are going to change the code in all 48 flying duck subclasses.

Software keeps changing or it dies.

So here is our first design principle: **_identify the aspects of your application
that vary and separate them from what stays the same_**.

Here is another way to think about this principle: **_take the parts that
vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts
that vary without affecting those that don't_**.

One example from my experience is that in the development of aventador VBS script,
I defined a `prbs_config` class. All the functions take an `prbs_config` as its
argument. So I can keep extending the `prbs_config` class and don't have to modify
the interface of those functions.

**Design Principle** *: Program to an interface, not an implementation.*

We'll use an interface to represent each behavior - for instance, `FlyBehaviour`
and `QuackBehaviour` - and each implementation of a *behavior* will implement one
of those interfaces.

So this time it won't be `Duck` to implement the flying and quacking interfaces.
Instead, we'll make a set of classes whose entire reason of living is to represent
behavior (e.g. squeaking), and it's the *behavior* class, rather than the `Duck`
class, that will implement the behavior interfaces.

This is in contrast to the way we were doing things before, where a behavior either
came from a concrete implementation in the super class `Duck`, or by providing a
specialized implementation in the subclass itself. In both cases, we were relying
on *implementation*. We were locked into using that specific implementation and
there was no room for changing out the behavior.

With our new design, the `Duck` subclasses will use a behavior represented by an
*interface*, (`FlyBehaviour` and `QuackBehaviour`), so that the actual `implementation`
of the behavior (in other words, the specific concrete behavior coded in the class
that implements the `FlyBehaviour` and `QuackBehaviour`) won't be locked into the
`Duck` subclass.

**Integrating the duck behavior**

The key is that a Duck will **delegate** its flying and quacking behavior, instead
of using quacking and flying methods defined in the `Duck` class.

```java
public class Duck {
    QuackBehavior quackBehavior;
    FlyBehavior flyBehavior;

    public void performQuack() {
        quackBehavior.quack();
    }

    public void performFly() {
        flyBehavior.fly();
    }

    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("All ducks swim, even decoys!");
    }

    public void setFlyBehavior(FlyBehavior fb) {
        flyBehavior = fb;
    }

    public void setQuackBehavior(QuackBehavior qb) {
        quackBehavior = qb;
    }
}

public class ModelDuck extends Duck {
    ModelDuck() {
        flyBehavior = new FlyNoWay();
        quackBehavior = new Quack();
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("I am a model duck!");
    }
}
```

The only problem with our current implementation is that: we should not programming
to an interface, but we are doing in that constructor, we are making a new instance
of a concrete `Quack` implementation class.

We are doing a poor job of initializing the instance variables in a flexible way.
We will fix it later using more patterns.

**The big pictures on encapsulated behaviors**

Instead of thinking of the duck behaviors as *a set of behaviors*, we'll start
think of them as a *family of algorithms*. in the SimUDuck design, the algorithms
represent things a duck would do (different ways of quacking or flying).

**Design Principles:** *Favor composition over inheritance*.

Creating systems using composition gives you a lot more flexibility. Not only
does it let you encapsulate a family of algorithms into their own set of classes,
but it also allows you to **_change behavior at runtime_**.

**Strategy Pattern**: defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and
makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.

**How to use design pattern**: We use libraries, frameworks, APIs, we can just
pick and choose components and plug them in. But they don't help us structure our
own application in ways that are easier to understand, more maintainable and flexible.
That's where design pattern comes in.

# Chapter 02 Keeping your objects in the know: Observer Pattern.

Observer Pattern keeps your objects in the know when something they might care
about happens. Objects can even decide at runtime whether they want to be kept
informed. It's one of the most heavily used pattern in JDK.

**Weather Monitoring Application**

Three players in this application:

* Weather Station: physical devices acquire actual weather data
* `WeatherData` object: tracks data coming in from weather station and updates
  display.
* display: show users current weather conditions.

Our job is to implement `measurementsChanged()` so that it updates the three
displays for current conditions, weather stats, and forecast.

The system have to be expandable: other developers can create new custom display
elements and users can add or remove as many display elements as they want to the
application.

Our first implementation below has the following problem:

* coding to concrete implementation, not interfaces.
* For every new display element we need to alter the code.
* We have no way to add or remove display elements at runtime.
* The display elements don't implement a common interface.
* We haven't encapsulated the part that changes.
* We are violating encapsulation of `WeatherData` class.

```java
public class WeatherData {

    private CurrentConditionsDisplay currentConditionsDisplay = new CurrentConditionsDisplay();
    private StatisticsDisplay statisticsDisplay = new StatisticsDisplay();
    private ForecastDisplay forecastDisplay = new ForecastDisplay();

    public void measurementsChanged() {
        double temp = getTemperature();
        double humidity = getHumidity();
        double pressure = getPressure();

        currentConditionsDisplay.update(temp, humidity, pressure);
        statisticsDisplay.update(temp, humidity, pressure);
        forecastDisplay.update(temp, humidity, pressure);
    }

}
```

**Observer Pattern**

Observer pattern is pretty much like the newspaper subscription. We call the
newspaper publisher `Subject`, and subscriber `Observer`.

**_Observer Pattern_** *defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object
changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically*.

Observer Pattern Class Diagram:
![Observer Pattern Class Diagram](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ObserverPatternClassDiagram.png)

**The Power of Loose Coupling**

When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little
knowledge about each other. The Observer Pattern provides an object design where
subjects and observers are loosely coupled. Because:

* The only thing the subject knows about an observer is that it implements a
  certain interface. It doesn't need to know anything else about observers.
* We can add new observers at any time.
* We never need to modify subject to add new types of observers. All we have to
  do is to implement the Observer interface in the new observers and register as
  an observer.
* We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other.
* Changes to either subject or an observer will not affect others. As long as the
  the objects still meet their obligations and implement their subject or observer
  interfaces.

**Design Principles** *: Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects and interact*.
Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change
because they minimize the interdependency between objects.

WeatherData Observer Pattern Diagram:
![WeatherData Observer Pattern Diagram](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/WeatherStationDiagram.png)

**Java built-in observer pattern**

![Java built-in observer pattern](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ObserverPatternJavaBuiltin.png)

Note that there are some difference between Java built-in Observer Pattern and
our implementation:

* We need to first call `setChanged()` before we call `notifyObservers()`.
    * Give us the flexibility to optimize notification. Sometimes we might not
      want to send notification too often, e.g. weather sensor is too sensitive.
      The dual function is called `clearChanged()`.
* There are two versions of `notifyObservers`:
    * `notifyObservers()`
    * `notifyObservers(Object arg)`
    * The one without arguments let the observers `pull` data from `Observable`. While
      the one with arguments `push` data to observers.
* The `update` method in the `Observer` interface has the following signature.
    * `update(Observable o, Object arg)`
* Our program cannot depend on the order of the `observers`.

**The dark side of `java.util.Observable`**

* `Observable` is a class, which means:
    * We have to *subclass* it, we can't add on the `Observable` behavior to an
      existing class that already extends another superclass.
    * We cannot create our own implementation, and cannot swap the `java.util`
      implementation for another (say, a multi-threaded implementation).
    * Question??? We can still override the method.
    * Violates our "program to interfaces not implementation".
* `Observable` protects crucial methods `setChanged`, which means:
    * We cannot create an instance of the `Observable` class and compose it with
      your own objects, we have to *subclass*.
    * Violates our "favor composition over inheritance".

**How Observer Pattern make use of principles**

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what
  stays the same
    * The thing changes in Observer Pattern is the state of subject and the type
      and number of observers. We can vary the observers.
* program to interfaces not implementation
    * Both subject and observers use interfaces. Subject keeps tracking objects
      implementing observer interface and observer register and get notified by
      subject interface.
* favor composition over inheritance
    * It composes any number of Observers with their subject.

# Chapter 03 Decorating Objects: Decorator Pattern

Once we know the techniques of decorating, we will be able to give our or someone
else's objects new responsibility without making any code changes to the underlying
class.

In the StarBuzz example, we do `cost` like the following, we will have some
problems:
* If the condiments price changes, we need to modify `Beverage` class.
* If we need to add new condiments, we have to modify `cost` method.
* If we have new beverage like `Tea`, it should not have `hasWhip()` method. It
  would be weird, it's not a green tea frapuccino.
* What if a customer wants double `Mocha`?

```java
public double cost(){
    double c = 0.0;
    if (hasMilk()) {
        c += milkCost;
    }
    if (hasSoy()) {
        c += soyCost;
    }
    if (hasMocha()) {
        c += mochaCost;
    }
    if (hasWhip()) {
        c += whipCost;
    }
    return c;
}
```

**Design Principle**: *Classes should be open for extension, but closed for
modification*.

"Code should be closed (to change) like lotus flower in the evening, yet open (
to extension) like the lotus flower in the morning".

While it seems like a contradiction, there are techniques for allowing code to be
extended without modification. Be careful when choosing these areas of code that
need to extended. Applying Open-Close Principle EVERYWHERE is wasteful, unnecessary,
and can lead to complex, hard to understand code.

**Decorator Pattern**: *attaches additional responsibility to an object dynamically
. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.*

Here are the class diagram for decorator pattern and how it gets applied on the
beverage problem:

![Decorator Pattern Class Diagram](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/DecoratorPatternClassDiagram.png)

![Decorator Pattern Beverage](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/DecoratorPatternBeverage.png)

Note that although `CondimentDecorator` inherit the `Beverage` class, we are using
inheritance to achieve *type matching* not to get *behavior*. We are using composition one
level after another, so we need to type matching. The new behavior comes in through
the composition of decorators with the base components as well as other decorators.
Because we use composition, we get a whole lot more flexibility about mix and match
condiments and beverages.

**`java.io` is a real world decorator**

Here is part of the class diagram for `java.io` library.

![Java IO Class Diagram](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ch03/JavaIOClassDiagram.png)

The diagram shows the downside of decorator pattern: results in too many small
classes that can be overwhelming to developers trying to use the Decorator-based
API.

Another dark side about Decorator Pattern is that if the client code is dependent
on specific types and when you start introducing decorators, bad things can happen.

# Chapter 04 Baking with OO Goodness: Factory Pattern

Get ready to know some loosely coupled design. **When you see "new", think "concrete"**.
When you use new, you are instantiating a concrete class, so that's definitely an
implementation not an interface. When we have the following code, we know when it
comes time for changes or extensions, we'll have to reopen the code and examines
what needs to be added. They also appear in several parts of our code, and make
our code error-prone and difficult to maintain.

```java
Duck duck;

if (picnic) {
  duck = new MallardDuck();
} else if (hunting) {
  duck = new DecoyDuck();
} else if (inBathTub) {
  duck = new RubberDuck();
}
```

When we have code that makes use of lots of concrete classes, that code may have
to be changed as new concrete classes are added. Our code won't be "closed to
modification". The principle we are going to use is _"identify the aspects of your application
that vary and separate them from what stays the same."_

We got a name for the new object: we call it "Factory", which handles the details
of object creation.

Although it seems like pushing problem to another object, but remember, we can
have multiple client, e.g. `PizzaShopMenu`, `HomeDelivery` as well as our current
`PizzaShop`. By encapsulating the pizza creation in one classes, we now only have
one place to make modification when implementation changes.

**Simple Factory Defined**

![Simple Factory](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ch04/SimpleFactoryClassDiagram.png)

## Franchising Pizza Store with Factory Pattern
We want to make more franchise in New York, Chicago and California. Each region
has different styles. But if we just use `SimpleFactory`, and compose one instance
of simple factory to a PizzaStore, we might not have enough quality control. For
example, what if we mistakenly assign an `NYPizzaFactory` to an Chicago store?

What we really want is to create a framework and ties the store and pizza together,
yet still allows things to remain flexible. Before, we tie the Pizza making code
to `PizzaStore`, and it's not flexible.

The solution is to move `createPizza` method back to `PizzaStore` and make it
`abstract`. See the code and diagram below. We will have a number of concrete
subclass of `PizzaStore`, each with it's own pizza variation, all fitting within
`PizzaStore` framework and still making use of the well-tuned `orderPizza()`
method. An abstract method handles object creation and encapsulates it in a
subclass. This decouples the client code in the super class from the object
creation code in the subclass.

```java
public abstract class PizzaStore {
    public Pizza orderPizza(String type) {

        Pizza pizza = createPizza(type);

        pizza.prepare();
        pizza.bake();
        pizza.cut();
        pizza.box();

        return pizza;
    }
    abstract Pizza createPizza(String type);
}
```

![Pizza Store Factory Diagram](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ch04/PizzaStoreFactoryDiagram.png)

**Factory Method Pattern**

It encapsulates object creation by letting subclasses decide what objects to create.

![Factory Method Pattern Diagram](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ch04/FactoryMethodPatternDiagram.png)

Another view of this pattern is it encapsulates product knowledge into each creator.

![Parallel Class Hierarchy](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ch04/ParallelClassHierarchy.png)

## Factory Method Pattern Defined

**_Factory Method Pattern_** *defines an interface for creating an object but let
subclass decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclass*.

Abstract Creator gives you an interface with a method for creating objects, also
know as the "factor method". Any other method implemented in the abstract Creator
are written to operate on product produced by the factory method. Only subclass
implement the factory method and create products. The creator class is written
without knowledge of the actual products that will be created, which is decided
purely by the choice of subclass that is used.

![Factory Method Pattern Diagram Generic](https://github.com/eroicaleo/DesignPatterns/blob/master/HeadFirst/ch04/FactoryMethodPatternDiagramGeneric.png)

The difference between `SimpleFactory` and `FactoryMethod`:
* `FactoryMethod`: by subclassing abstract creator, e.g. `PizzaStore`, you decide
  what concrete products go into making the pizza that `orderPizza()` returns.
* `SimpleFactory`: gives a way to encapsulate object creation, but doesn't give
  you a way to the flexibility, because there is no way to vary the products you
	are creating.

## The Dependent Inversion Principle

If we implement the following way, this version of `PizzaStore` depends on all
those `pizza` objects, because it's creating them directly. Any changes in one
concrete `pizza` class, we may need to modify the `PizzaStore`. We call the
`PizzaStore` "depends on" the `pizza` implementation.

```java
if (style == "NY") {
		if (type.equals("cheese")) {
		} else if (type.equals("pepperoni")) {
		}
} else if (style == "Chicago") {
		if (type.equals("cheese")) {
		} else if (type.equals("pepperoni")) {
		}
}
```

**_Design Principle: Dependent Inversion Principle_**: *Depend upon abstractions.
Do not depend upon concrete classes.*

It suggests high-level objects should not depend on our low-level components.
They should both depend on abstractions. `PizzaStore` is high-level components.
The implementation of `Pizza` is low-level components. We should write our code
so that we are depending on abstractions not concrete classes.

After applying `FactoryMethod`, high-level components `PizzaStore` and low-level
components all those pizzas, both depend on `Pizza` the abstraction.

Some guidelines to avoid violation of the dependent inversion principle:
* No variable should should a reference to a concrete class.
		* if you use `new`, you'll be holding a reference to a concrete class. Use a
			factory to get around it.
* No class should derive from a concrete class.
		* you are depending on a concrete class. Derive from an abstract class or an
			interface.
* No method should override an implementation method of any of its base class.

These are just guidelines not rules to follow.

## Adding Ingredients

* All Objectville Pizza have same components, but each region has different
implementation of those components.
* Each family consists of a type of dough, a type of sauce, a type of cheese
and a seafood toppings.

Again we can use Factory to create ingredients.

1. Define an interface for the factory to create our ingredients.
	```java
	public interface PizzaIngredientFactory {
    public Dough createDough();
    public Sauce createSauce();
    public Cheese createCheese();
    public Veggies[] createVeggies();
    public Pepperoni createPepperoni();
    public Clams createClams();
	}
	```
2. Build a factory for each region.
	```java
	public class NYPizzaIngredientFactory implements PizzaIngredientFactory {
    @Override
    public Dough createDough() {
        return new ThinCrustDough();
    }

    @Override
    public Sauce createSauce() {
        return new MarinaraSauce();
    }
		// omit the following similar code
	}
	```
3. implement a set of ingredient class like `ReggianoCheese`.
	```java
	public class ReggianoCheese extends Cheese {
  }
	```
4. Reworking the `Pizza` class. Make the `prepare()` method abstract.
	```java
	public abstract class Pizza {

    String name;
    Dough dough;
    Sauce sauce;
    Cheese cheese;
    Veggies veggies[];
    Pepperoni pepperoni;
    Clams clam;

    public Pizza() {
    }

    public abstract void prepare();
    // omit other bake, cut, box which is the same as before.
  }
	```
5. Reworking the concrete `Pizza` type. Now we need composition an instance of
	`PizzaIngredientFactory` in the `CheesePizza` class. The ingredients produced
	depends on the factory. The `Pizza` class does not care how to make pizza. It's
	decoupled from regional difference and can be easily reused when there are more
	other factories.
	```java
	public class CheesePizza extends Pizza {
    PizzaIngredientFactory ingredientFactory;

    public CheesePizza(PizzaIngredientFactory ingredientFactory) {
        this.ingredientFactory = ingredientFactory;
    }

    @Override
    public void prepare() {
        System.out.println("Preparing " + name);
        dough = ingredientFactory.createDough();
        sauce = ingredientFactory.createSauce();
        cheese = ingredientFactory.createCheese();

    }
	}
	```
